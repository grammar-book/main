## Indefinite articles

#### Rule

Use it before a `singular count nouns` or when its `identity is not known` to the reader.

#### Schemes:

- `a`  noun starts with unfamiliar identity and **consonant sound**
- `an`  noun starts wit unfamiliar identity and **vowel sound**

#### Examples:
```
- I want to drive a car.
- I want to eat an apple.
```
_Both of these Nouns are used for the first time in a conversation, so it is correct to use an indefinite article._

## Definite article

#### Rule:

Use it before a noun to indicate that `an identity of a noun is known to` a reader or a listener.

#### Scheme:

- `the` noun with familiar identity

#### Examples:
```
- Do you want an apple? 
- Yes, please give me the apple.
```
_The noun apple was used the second time._


## No article

#### Rule:

Use it before a `plural count` or `non count nouns` or `any used to mean all or in general`.

#### Scheme:

- ` ` plural count noun
- ` ` non count noun
- ` ` noun means in general

#### Examples:
```
- Do you want an apple? 
- Yes, please give me some apples.
```
_The noun apples in plural form, so it's correct to use it without article._
