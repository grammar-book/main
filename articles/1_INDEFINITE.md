## Indefinite articles

#### Rule:

Use it before a `singular count nouns` or when its `identity is not known` to the reader.

#### Schemas:

- `a`  noun starts with unfamiliar identity and **consonant sound**
- `an`  noun starts wit unfamiliar identity and **vowel sound**

#### Hints:
- Words starts from `U` letter can produce a consonant sound, then it leads to use the `a` article.  
  For example: `a uniform`, `a unity`  
  Opposite: `an umbrella`

#### Examples:
```
- I want to drive a car.
- I want to eat an apple.
- I like wear a uniform.
```
_Both of these Nouns are used for the first time in a conversation, so it is correct to use an indefinite article._
