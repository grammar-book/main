## 3. No article

#### Rule:

Use it before a `plural count` or `non count nouns` or `any used to mean all or in general`.

#### Schemas:

- ` ` plural count noun
- ` ` non count noun
- ` ` noun means in general

#### Examples:
```
- Do you want an apple? 
- Yes, please give me some apples.
```
_The noun apples in plural form, so it's correct to use it without article._
