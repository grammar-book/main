## Indefinite articles

#### Rule

Use it before a `singular count nouns` or when its `identity is not known` to the reader.

#### Schemes:

- `a`  noun starts with unfamiliar identity and **consonant sound**
- `an`  noun starts wit unfamiliar identity and **vowel sound**

#### Examples:
```
- I want to drive a car.
- I want to eat an apple.
```
_Both of these Nouns are used for the first time in a conversation, so it is correct to use an indefinite article._
